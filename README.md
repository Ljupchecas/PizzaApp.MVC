# PizzaApp.MVC

Crafted a Pizza MVC application tailored specifically for managing pizza orders and related services.

Implemented CRUD operations to handle pizzas, orders, and users effectively. This includes functionalities for creating new pizzas, placing orders, updating existing records, and removing outdated data.

Incorporated robust logging functionality to maintain a comprehensive history of pizza orders and user interactions. This logging system captures essential details such as order timestamps, user activities, and modifications to pizza listings, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the application's endpoints. Utilizing industry-standard protocols, the app verifies user identities and regulates access to sensitive functionalities, safeguarding the integrity of pizza orders and user data.

Designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, the Pizza MVC app serves as a solid foundation for building pizza delivery systems in ASP.NET. Its modular architecture facilitates seamless integration of new features and enhancements, while adherence to coding best practices ensures code maintainability and longevity.
